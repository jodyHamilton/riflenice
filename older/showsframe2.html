The flier says it all in this case.  Saturday October 22nd at the Mill Creek we will do our thing.  No spongebob theme will be involved.<br><br>

Friday, August 19th: Very excited to battle our perky alter-egos, the Snow Fairies, at the Mill Creek.  For the occasion we will play our most scary dance numbers, and hope to see some weird moves busted. <br><br>
Saturday, July 23rd: We are going back to our devoted fans, to play in the basement of 213 S. 46th St (just south of Walnut).  I believe there will be kegs.  And way more of the friendly artist type kids than the crust punk aggressives.  What time will we play?  Like around party time I guess.  <br>
