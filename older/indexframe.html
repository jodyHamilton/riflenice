For example, our at-last-completed full-length album which will be in our hands in mid-September.  As you may realize, Rifle Nice has absolutely nothing going on on the hype end of things- no label, no press, no distribution.  Do we even need all that clusterfuck hoopla in our lives?  Our album is going to be available only via this site and store.  We'll let you know how that works out.</font></P>

<tr><td><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2" color="#000000"><a href="comebyit.mp3">'Come by it Naturally'</a> was originally a really mediocre guitar song I played with Steve and Pete Gavin years ago during some heavy drinking sessions.  Then it improved somewhat into a keyboard jam on my second <a href="http://flatjody.com/driving.html"> 'album.'</a>  Soon after, Alicia drew an accompanying picture book.  This is all way back when.  There was a child's desk (currently residing in my attic) where one could sit and examine the book while listening to the song on attached headphones.  There was also an 'amusing' multiple choice exam one could take during or after studying the 'C b i N' experience (whereabouts currently unknown, however there is a new online <a href="/comebyit/comebyit.php">personality quiz</a> you can take instead).  All of this was part of a show best described as the fringe of the fringe of the fringe festival, dark days indeed.  With the formation of Rifle Nice in early 2004 the song was immediately revived and became an RN staple, although the words changed a little due to forgetting them.  And it now features Alicia and Jim playing the mother and father where previously I would have to throw my voice.  After many years missing, Alicia's picture book too has been recovered and I have now roughly <a href="comebyitstream.mov">animated</a> it to make it a little more '2006.'   I have to admit after all of this I still do not really have the words straight yet. <br><br>
